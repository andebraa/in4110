#Web visualization.py:#

	Runs a flask webapp which can be opened locally. Here all the daily, cumulative and both can be plotted. 
	All counties, weekly and daily data is included in /resources folder. 
	The time range feature is not implemented in app, but can be acsessed by manually calling the desired method in the code. 
	Many of the flask methods are rendered through templates located in /templates.
	Data for the plots can be found in resources. This is limited to data at the time i begun this assignment. Would be neat to add a simple download feature to keep this up to date.
	
	NOTE: there is an mouseover option for all cases, but the cumulative cases for weekly data is realy shabby, so you have to hit a very distinct point on the curve. 
	Oh and weekly data works now too. despite old push comments
